Hello and welcome to this icon pack of almost 850 icons (not including customizable ones) made in the style of GTA artworks.

This pack took me over 6 months to make. Itâ€™s a huge job and I hope you like it!

I created a discord to chat with me and show me your ingame integration.

Future updates (if there are any, I'm exhausted haha) will be available on the discord

I remind you to contact me before any commercial use, whether on GTA via servers with integrated stores or outside GTA.

Many people liked the free weapon pack, I hope you like the full version.

thank you.
